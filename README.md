# The MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework is the backbone of this project, enabling seamless multi-server orchestration and advanced reasoning capabilities. By leveraging MCP, the project integrates diverse services, such as weather data APIs and geocoding tools, into a unified, modular architecture. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient communication between components, making MCP a critical enabler for the project's success.
